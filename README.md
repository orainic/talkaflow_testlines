## üìù Adding New Agents

1. **Update `agents-config.json`** - Add new agent configuration
2. **Update `vercel.json`** - Add new route pattern
3. **Deploy** - Push to GitHub, Vercel auto-deploys

## üîç Troubleshooting Call Drop-Offs

When clients report that calls are dropping:

1. **Access the Log Viewer:** Go to https://talkaflow-testlines.vercel.app/logs
2. **Find the Session:**
   - Ask client when the call happened
   - Use time-based filtering or search for their session
   - Each call has a unique session ID
3. **Analyze the Logs:**
   - Look for "CALL DISCONNECTED" events
   - Check call duration (short calls <10s indicate timeout/mic issues)
   - Review disconnect reasons and network status
   - Check for error messages before disconnect
4. **Common Issues:**
   - **Short calls:** Usually microphone permission or agent timeout
   - **Network errors:** Check client's connection type and stability
   - **WebSocket errors:** May indicate firewall or network restrictions

### Enable Persistent Log Storage (Optional)

For better log retention and searchability:

```bash
# Install Vercel KV
npm install @vercel/kv

# Configure in Vercel Dashboard:
# 1. Go to your project ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Create KV Database
# 2. Link to your project
# 3. Redeploy
```

With Vercel KV enabled, logs are stored persistently and accessible via the web viewer.

## üîê Security & Privacy

- **API Key Protection:** API key stored server-side in `api/ultravox.js` (not exposed to clients)
- **CORS Configuration:** Properly configured for cross-origin requests
- **Public Agent IDs:** Agent IDs are safe to expose (no sensitive data)
- **Technology Obfuscation:** Underlying technology (Ultravox) rebranded as "talkaflow-uvx" in client-facing logs
- **Client Privacy:** IP addresses and browser info logged only for debugging purposes
- **Log Access Control:** Log viewer should be protected (add authentication if needed)
